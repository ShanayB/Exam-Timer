# Exam Timer
JavaScript-based easy-to-use timer for display at (school/university) exams. 

This timer assists pupils and students to keep track of time during exams. As such, this timer depicts the current time as well as both the passed and remaining time. Moreover, you could vary coloring and include remarks (e.g., what to do with the exam after finishing it). Oh, and everything is local and noncommercial. That is, no data ist stored, no advertising, no pricing, no costs.

## Requirements
A PHP-capable web server and a JavaScript-enabled web browser.

## Installation
The easiest way is to just use https://time.datenfruehstueck.de/. If you want to install it on your own server, just clone the files within `dist/` and you are ready to go. Ultimately, you can always clone the complete repository, have nodejs installed, navigate to the repository's main directory, run `npm install`, `bower install` and `gulp`.

## Translation
All language specifics are located within the `static/i18n_XY.json` files. If you want to enhance this project (e.g., by translating it into French, Spanish, or Latin -- depending on the subject you are teaching), feel free to generate a new such file and either pull-request it or just send it to me.
